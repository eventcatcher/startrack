The Beta-Version of MagiC 5.13 for the Hades has a Bug that deletes the Hades-Cookie.
But, this Cookie is absolutely important for the audiodriver !

The program HADECOOK.PRG installes this cookie after MAGIC is loading. If you use this
Betaversion of MagiC,please copy the HADECOOK.PRG in the Autofolder direct in the following
sequence: 

HADECOOK.PRG 
SOUND.PRG.

In official MagiC-Versions you don't need this Patch !
