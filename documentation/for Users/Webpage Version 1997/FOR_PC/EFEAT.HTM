E.g. with 4 Soundcards you then have a system with<BR><BR>8 analog Inputs, 8 analog Outputs and 4 digital Inputs and Outputs.<BR><BR>You can additionally extend these 4 soundcards with DSP expansion boards<BR><BR>via the DSP ports (Analog 8, ADAT, Jam-In/Out) in theory<BR><BR>extending the system to 32 In and 64 Outputs (Dual Port option) !<BR><BR>You can extend each soundcard with it's own DSP processor and you have now<BR><BR>limitless power.
