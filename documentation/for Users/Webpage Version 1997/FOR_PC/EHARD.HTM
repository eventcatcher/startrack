The copy protection can be cleared from SCMS (serial copy<BR><BR>management system) protected digital sources on the digital input.<BR><BR>You can copy your own records with the digital output without loss to your<BR><BR>DAT/DCC/MD/CD recorder. With this feature you can set whether copying <BR><BR>is allowed: no copy, one copy or full copy (without copy protection)<BR><BR>from your recording.<BR><BR>The digital inputs and outputs support 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz sample rate<BR><BR>and now 96kHz sample rate with brand new SP/DIF Chips. With these new<BR><BR>SP/DIF Chips you can now produce 24Bit digital mastering !!!<BR><BR>The Soundcard has a Stereo 16Bit A/D converter for analog sources and a<BR><BR>18Bit D/A converter for the analog output. The converters (not cheap CODECS<BR><BR>as in the Falcon or most of the PC Soundcards) are 64x oversampled deltasigma linear<BR><BR>converters from the highly reputed company, Crystal, and are first classconverters.<BR><BR>The high quality from these converters are certified by many HIFI magazines.<BR><BR>In co-operation with the digital in and output, the soundcard can run ina<BR><BR>four channel mode. In this mode you can simultaneously record and playback<BR><BR>four channels.<BR><BR>A de-emphasis circuit is integrated in the Soundcard and can be controlledby<BR><BR>the editor program. This is necessary, because a few CDs (e.g. from Heaven17)<BR><BR>boost the treble up to try and eliminate noise.<BR><BR>The Soundcard has two digitally adjustable high end volume controllers inthe range<BR><BR>-96dB to +32dB, channel seperated in 256 adjustable steps for the<BR><BR>A/D converter input (record) and as well for the D/A converter output (playback).<BR><BR>The Startrack card is fully capable for harddisk recording. (even withoutDSP expansion).<BR><BR>You can install a DSP expansion card for the Startrack soundcard. This extension<BR><BR>uses a Motorola DSP 56002-66 (double the Falcon speed, fully compatiblewith the Falcon DSP)<BR><BR>and 128K x 24Bit (four times that of the Falcon) of static fastram (12ns).<BR><BR>The DSP is not required for harddisk recording, the HDR soundcard buffersthe<BR><BR>transfer itself (like the DMA Matrix in the Falcon).<BR><BR>The DSP is excellent for mixing and effects and can work in parallel tothe<BR><BR>soundcard transfer. You can switch the DSP in the input section or in the<BR><BR>output section with the sample editor. On the DSP expansion is a Falconcompatible<BR><BR>DSP port for Falcon Audio Expansions (Analog8, ADAT, JAM In/Out, FA8)<BR><BR>e.g. for 8 outputs. (digital or analog)<BR><BR>Optionally you can have a &quot;tuned&quot; DSP Double Port for 2 audioexpansions<BR><BR>(2x Analog8, JAM-Out) for 16 outputs! That pushes your TOS Computer to higher<BR><BR>Musical spheres!<BR><BR>The DSP Debugport (ONCE) is also present and allows developers<BR><BR>and software programmers comfortable hardware debugging of DSP programs.<BR><BR>This port is compatible to the Development tool EVM56002 from Motorola.<BR><BR>The Debug software (for PCs) is freely available and allows among otherthings,<BR><BR>breakpoints, trace, read and change registers etc.<BR><BR>The DSP slot on the HDR soundcard, in principle, allows other DSPs<BR><BR>or expansion possibilities. Write me with your ideas and inspire me!<BR><BR>By adding the XLR extension card, the Soundcard produces full studio quality<BR><BR>sound. You have 6 XLR connectors. The XLR Analog Inputs <BR><BR>(2 female XLR) and the XLR Analog Outputs (2 male XLR) work with higher<BR><BR>studio level (higher Volume level). Additionally, you have an AES/EBU digital<BR><BR>input (female XLR) and output (male XLR), both with transformers.<BR><BR>You can switch the 3 digital Inputs (optical, cinch and XLR) with the<BR><BR>sample editor software (without rearranging the cables).<BR><BR>The XLR PCB will be available in the Autumn of &acute;97.<BR><BR>The A/D and D/A converters support the standards 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz,<BR><BR>as well 8/11/12/16/16.5/22.1/24 and 33.1 kHz are optionally supported withan<BR><BR>external clock with the 768x, 512x, 384x or 256x sample rate.<BR><BR>As well, a sample rate clock output (wordclock) is included.<BR><BR>With it you can connect the Soundcard directly to a CD mechanism.<BR><BR>This is possible with a few High End CD Players and prevents Jitter.</H4><PRE><B>The Startrack Card and the DSP expansion are in production andwill be available in the Summer of &acute;97.</B></PRE><H4>Thank you for your interest, Stephan</H4><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P><A HREF="emain.html"><STRONG>back to mainpage...</STRONG></A> </BODY></HTML>
