The <BR><BR>Startrack Card and the DSP expansion<BR><BR>are in production will definately be available<BR><BR>at the end of July / beginning of August.<BR><BR><BR>Now, a few features of the<BR><BR>Startrack Card and of the DSP expansion<BR><BR>that are newly released.</CENTER></H4><P><CENTER><BR></CENTER><H2><CENTER>More DSP</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER><H4><CENTER>The DSP expansion definately works!<BR><BR>Using a Motorola DSP56002 with<BR><BR>66MHz clockrate, which is fully<BR><BR>compatible to the DSP56001 in the Falcon.<BR><BR>This is double the speed<BR><BR>compared with the Falcon.<BR><BR>In these times of high CPU clocks, you<BR><BR>may think this is not very high.<BR><BR>However, don't forget that a<BR><BR>DSP is a highly specialized processor<BR><BR>used for signal processing, that runs program<BR><BR>code in parallel with the main CPU<BR><BR>and uses the memory without waitstates<BR><BR>(with 66MHz each 15ns).<BR><BR>In a german music journal I could quote<BR><BR>from a competent writer,<BR><BR>that this DSP has a higher power<BR><BR>than an Intel Pentium Pro(R) at 200MHz !<BR><BR>Indeed, relative to the music signalprocessing.<BR><BR>On the DSP expansion is an additional<BR><BR>and very fast Cache Memory with<BR><BR>128K x 24Bit SRAM. That&acute;s four times as<BR><BR>in the Falcon and is almost the maximum<BR><BR>possible Memory that the<BR><BR>DSP theoretically can use.<BR><BR>In combination with the DSP expansion, it is now<BR><BR>possible for the card to be used in the four track mode.<BR><BR>Thereby, the digital SP/DIF connection are <BR><BR>used as an additional Stereo In and <BR><BR>Output together with the Analog connection.<BR><BR>The Debug Port (ONCE) is included.<BR><BR>With this and with a PC Debugger (free),<BR><BR>you can set breakpoints, trace the program, <BR><BR>change registers and many more options. <BR><BR>The Debug Port is connected with a PC<BR><BR>via a serial COM Port<BR><BR>and is compatible to the Motorola<BR><BR>EVM56002 Evaluation board.<BR><BR>As well you have a serial link (RS232)<BR><BR>to the Host Port of the DSP.<BR><BR>But this is surely only interesting for a few <BR><BR>hardware freaks and programmers...</CENTER></H4><P><CENTER><BR></CENTER><H2><CENTER>More Sound</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER><H4><CENTER>The Startrack Card now has more features:<BR><BR><BR>With the recently released new SP/DIF IC's<BR><BR>onboard, you can produce a<BR><BR>clean digital 24Bit Mastering at<BR><BR>96kHz Samplerate !<BR><BR>So, this is world-wide, the first<BR><BR>sampling card with 96kHz sample rate (I hope).<BR><BR>Optionally it is possible, with a bigger (but costly) PLD Chip<BR><BR>to produce an extended DSP Port <BR><BR>(DSP Double Port Option) for connection of<BR><BR>two Falcon Audio expansions to be used in parallel .</CENTER></H4><P><CENTER><BR></CENTER><H2><CENTER>What does this mean ?</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER><H4><CENTER>You can connect e.g. two Soundpool Analog8<BR><BR>for 16 seperate Analogue Outs!!<BR><BR>The soundcard and the software<BR><BR>then output 16 channels with full 16Bit<BR><BR>(no Falcon usual data reduction due to<BR><BR>compression for 16 Track mode).<BR><BR>Because this feature is not needed by all users and the<BR><BR>card price would increase, this feature<BR><BR>is optional at an additional cost.<BR><BR>However, you can expand your card with this DSP Double Port at any time.</CENTER></H4><P><CENTER><BR></CENTER><H2><CENTER>Full power with Atari TT - indeed !</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER><H4><CENTER>The soundcard is accurately tested <BR><BR>on an Atari TT. The power of the TT's<BR><BR>68030 CPU is not too high.<BR><BR>Therefore, you should absolutely use the<BR><BR>DSP expansion board so that the TT is not<BR><BR>bogged down by mix and other processor intensive chores. <BR><BR>With the DSP expansion the TT can also<BR><BR>playback and output 8 Tracks/48kHz <BR><BR>without problems !</CENTER></H4><P><CENTER><BR></CENTER><H2><CENTER>Call for more Info material, or write to:</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER><H4><CENTER>MW electronic ComputerSysteme<BR><BR>Heisterbacher Str. 96<BR><BR>D-53639 K&ouml;nigswinter, Germany<BR><BR>Tel: 02223/1567, Fax: 26982</CENTER></H4><H3><CENTER>...or send me a email : <A HREF="mailto:Stepwil@aol.com">Stepwil@aol.com</A></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P><A HREF="emain.html"><STRONG>back to mainpage...<BR></STRONG></A></BODY></HTML>
