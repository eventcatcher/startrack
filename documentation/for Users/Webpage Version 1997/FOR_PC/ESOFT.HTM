A <A HREF="ftp://members.aol.com/vmestartrk/testsmpl.zip">testsample</A>can be downloaded as well.</H3><H2><CENTER>The software features:</CENTER></H2><PRE><HR ALIGN="LEFT"></PRE><H4>The list refers to the alpha version of the STARTRACK software V1.05a<BR><BR>and the features are subject to modification!<BR><BR><BR><BR>All windows, where sensible, use non-modal techniques (remain opened).<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- edit window (always open, non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>This is the control desk of the program where you perform all operations.<BR><BR>The central element of the edit window is the graphical presentation ofthe samples.<BR><BR>You can move and set markers, copy and move samples directly via drag anddrop.<BR><BR>Of course, you can work with the samples in the RAM memory (destructiveediting).<BR><BR>And you have a virtual mode for samples that are larger then the RAM memory.<BR><BR>In the virtual mode you see the samples in the edit window and you can editthem,<BR><BR>but the samples are not actually in RAM memory, rather, on the hard disk.<BR><BR>If you try to load a sample file, that is greater than the sample RAM memory<BR><BR>a dialog box then appears, where you can select between virtual editingor block loading.<BR><BR>Before you select block loading, you can select which block part you willbe loading.<BR><BR>You can play the block before you load the block. This is good for searchinga block in the sample.<BR><BR>The editor is designed for control and direct (destructive) editing of samples.<BR>. <BR>The markers for (s)tart, (e)nd, (i)ntro und (r)elease are shown in the editoras vertical lines. <BR><BR>You can drag it to another position with the mouse, and with a click onthe marker entry you can<BR><BR>input the marker position directly. These markers you can then copy to theclipboard<BR><BR>(Starfleet symbol in the right corner, below) with drag &amp; drop whileyou drag the suitable<BR><BR>marker button to the clipboard.<BR><BR>Thereafter, you can drag the copied marker entry from the clipboard to amarker button <BR><BR>(button s, e, i or r) to copy this to a new marker entry. <BR><BR>When you copy all entries of a marker set, you drag the button with themarker number<BR><BR>(left from the marker buttons) to the clipboard and thereafter from theclipboard to the<BR><BR>new marker number. You have a max. of 100 Marker sets.<BR><BR>You can give each entry a comment for better distinguishing of the manymarkers.<BR><BR>Zoom and scroll functions give the possibility to join several samples.<BR><BR>You can fade-in and fade-out, and you have even a fade editor where youcan edit your own fader curves. <BR><BR>You can delete clicks from an old record with the mouse. Respectively thevalues adapt to the wave cycle. <BR><BR>Zoom commands are automatically recorded with an UNDO function.<BR><BR>You can input the marker values directly into a dialog box as sample valueor time value or with the<BR><BR>mouse in the sample window. You can directly in the sample editor, use allrecord/play functions.<BR><BR>A marker show you the actual record/play position (if you make a record/playin the sample memory).<BR><BR>You can play a sample at the same time as you make a new recording.<BR><BR>This is useful if you record additional synchronous tracks, like in themusic studios,<BR><BR>e.g. first record the drums, then the bass, leadguitar, voice.<BR><BR>The editor has an easy zero position (space) search function via Drag andDrop.<BR><BR>You pick up the marker with the mouse and you click the left or right shiftkey.<BR><BR>If you let loose now of the marker, it searches for the next zero valueleft or right from<BR><BR>the starting point where you have let go of the marker. Very simple andvery useful for searching loop points.<BR><BR>You can loop pieces from a sample and trigger this sample from a MIDI keyboard.<BR><BR>For this, you set the sample to be triggered, to an adjustable midi channeland a midi note.<BR><BR>The editor has an auto backup function that allows you to make an automatedsafety backup copy<BR><BR>on the hard disk, after a user adjustable and definable period of time.<BR><BR>The program supports the following sample formats: S16, WAV, AVR, SND, SD,AU and SMP.<BR><BR>You have multiple possibilities in the setup dialog for adjusting the presentationof the samples<BR><BR>in the editor, data paths and other things. You can adjust in the Setup,that all open windows at the<BR><BR>next start of the program appears in the same place on the monitor (on theplace the windows are<BR><BR>before you have saved the Setup). All important setups you can save in aSetup file (with SAVE<BR><BR>in the setup dialog) and are automatically loaded at the next start of theprogram.<BR><BR>At the top border of the edit window are various buttons for the main functionsand for calling<BR><BR>up additional windows. <BR><BR><BR>They are:</H4><H3><I><STRONG>- connection window (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>* shows error codes and sample rate of the digital inputs<BR><BR>* shows the source status of the digital inputs (SCMS, emphasis, audio/data,consumer/professional)<BR><BR>* adjustable sample rate and source selection<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- editor toolbar (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>with functions for cut, insert, space, optimize, resample, stereo/mono,negate, change<BR><BR>* cut - for cutting the samples (cut in/out/delete)<BR><BR>* insert - for uniting several samples<BR><BR>* space - for input of silent pieces<BR><BR>* optimize - for correction of the levels<BR><BR>* resample - for changing (recalculate) the sample rate without changingthe speed<BR><BR>* stereo/mono - for changing the stereo recording into a mono recording<BR><BR>* negate - for negating the sample data (positive vibrations become negativeand reverse)<BR><BR>* change - for change the channels from left to right and reverse<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- peakmeter (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>This is the main window for recording and playing samples.<BR><BR>This can also be done in the edit window, but, the peakmeter is more comfortable.<BR><BR>You have a very exact levelmeter with gain controller, a mute key, a balancecontroller,<BR><BR>a recordtime monitor and peak and errorcounter for monitoring faults. <BR><BR>With it, you can very quickly find out if you are blasting the record oryour computer is too slow<BR><BR>(buffer overflow, loss of sampledata) because too many programs run parallelon the machine<BR><BR>(MTOS, Magic) or the computer is simply too slow for this (MC68000).<BR><BR>If you have you a sample recorded (in the sample memory), the program switchesautomatically to<BR><BR>the edit window and displays the sample. Now you can work with it - veryuseful !<BR><BR>A sample that you have hard disk recorded, you must first load in the editorfor working.<BR><BR>The peakmeter window offers the common controls of a tapedeck (record, play,stop, pause).<BR><BR>As well the program can wait for an optional adjustable level for automaticrecord start when<BR><BR>the music begins.<BR><BR>Before you make a recording, you first select between record in the samplememory and record to<BR><BR>hard disk (HDR sampling). These controls are also available in the editwindow, but, without<BR><BR>a peakmeter and a gain controller.<BR><BR>If you make a recording to harddisk, the program saves an INF file beforethe recording starts.<BR><BR>In this INF file is the samplerate, date of record, loop-marker and a commentare saved.<BR><BR>This comment is input into an edit field in the info dialog box. You canuse it for a title description<BR><BR>from the recording. This is useful for identifying older recordings.<BR><BR>This INF file is shown when you load a sample or in the special hyper filesector(see musicbox).<BR><BR>During the recording the program saves a &quot;.PBF&quot; file. This isa cache file with a compressed version<BR><BR>of the amplitudes. This make the screen redraw faster if you load very longsamples. Normally the<BR><BR>program calculates all new sample values for a screen redraw. For a samplewith large (50-100 MByte) <BR><BR>it is very calculation intensive. Instead, the program calculates this amplitudecache during the<BR><BR>recording and saves this to the hard disk. The amplitude cache is much smallerthan the sample<BR><BR>(about a factor of 256). If you work with the sample, search the programfirst to this cache file and <BR><BR>use it for amplitude calculation.<BR><BR>Ohh, before I forget this: if you make a recording from digital inputs youcan not control the level<BR><BR>(for what?)<BR><BR>The level can be controlled after the recording if you play the sample inthe peakmeter window.<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- MIDI and playlist window (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you can distribute your of the harddisk accumulated samples tothe MIDI channels and MIDI notes<BR><BR>and trigger the samples with a MIDI keyboard. You create a playlist withthe used samples.<BR><BR>You can setup the sample rate for play and the loop for each sample.<BR><BR>You have copy functions (with drag and drop) and many edit functions forselecting the sample pieces<BR><BR>(start position, end position, play and record functions).<BR><BR>These sample entries can be copied to the clipboard (clipboard symbol inthe left corner, below) with<BR><BR>drag &amp; drop while you drag the suitable edit button to the clipboard.<BR><BR>Thereafter, you can drag the copied sample entry from the clipboard to aedit button to copy this to<BR><BR>a new sample entry. You can save and load this playlist. The arranger filehas the file extender &quot;.ARR&quot;.<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- loop window (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you select the play mode between forward play,backward play orcross play<BR><BR>(forward play and then backward play)<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- fader window (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you can edit the curve for the fade-in and fade-out-functions.<BR><BR>You can draw new curves with the mouse or you can use the prepared curves<BR><BR>(linear, square, exp, sqrt, log).<BR><BR>These curves you can save and load (file-extension &quot;.FAD&quot;).<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- monitor (function)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>With this function you can control the correct function of the sampler<BR><BR>respectively if the sampler has dropouts (computer is too slow or otherproblems).<BR><BR>For this, the sampler receive samples from the input and sends it directlyto the output.<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- MIDI note (modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you can adjust the MIDI note and the MIDI channel for triggeringthe sample in the<BR><BR>edit window with a MIDI keyboard.<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- load and save (modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you can save or load the sample.<BR><BR>If you load a sample, you can select between loading this sample alone<BR><BR>in the sample memory (clear the program of the previous sample in memory)or<BR><BR>load the sample at the end of the other samples in the memory. <BR><BR>If you save a sample, you can select between save all sample memory or<BR><BR>save a block (defined with the markers &quot;s&quot; and &quot;e&quot;).</H4><PRE> </PRE><H3><I><STRONG>- DSP toolbar (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you can load effects and enter your own LOD files in the DSP.<BR><BR>You can select between echo, lowpass, flanger, chorus, pinknoise and bypass.<BR><BR>Intended for the future is hall, highpass, bandbass, equalizer and othereffects.<BR><BR>The editor can load your own DSP programs (or from other companys) in theLOD format.<BR><BR>You can make your own DSP effects !!!<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- hyper fileselector (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>Here you can define a playlist (with the fileselector) for playing completemusic titles<BR><BR>in a fixed sequence. This playlist can be saved and loaded (file extension&quot;.BOX&quot;).<BR><BR>First, you define a filesearch path for the samples with the fileselectorand add this<BR><BR>path to the pathlist (file-extender &quot;.SEL&quot;) with the ADD button.<BR><BR>With the ADD button you can define several search paths for the samples.<BR><BR>In all these paths in the pathlist the hyper fileselector searches the samples<BR><BR>and displays them in the hyper fileselector. If you wish to make a new pathlist,<BR><BR>use the &quot;NEW&quot; button.<BR><BR>The found samples and the comments from the sample INF files are shown inthe<BR><BR>hyper fileselector for easy search in great data inventories.<BR><BR>Then, you select the sample that you will play and insert it in the<BR><BR>musicbox playlist with the insert button. Do this for all the samples inthe<BR><BR>order that you wish them to play. To play this list, push the <BR><BR>musicbox button. You see a list with all the samples that you have defined<BR><BR>in the musicbox playlist. With this button, you can change between<BR><BR>the general view and the musicbox playlist. If you have change to the musicbox,<BR><BR>push play and you will hear the samples in the defined sequence.<BR><BR>A scan play function is also available. With this you play the first 10seconds of the sample.<BR><BR>You can use this window as a fileselector for loading a sample in the editor.You select<BR><BR>a sample with the mouse and push the load button - that&acute;s all.<BR><BR>The advantage from this method is, that you see all samples in the searchpaths as<BR><BR>one great list and you see the comments for each sample for identifyinga sample, and<BR><BR>the other files that are not samples are not listed.</H4><PRE> </PRE><H3><I><STRONG>- multitrack window (non-modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>This is one of the most important windows.<BR><BR>The x-axis define the time and on the y-axis are the tracks.<BR><BR>Here you can define a playlist for a max. of 99 virtual stereo channels.<BR><BR>With this, you can select a max. of 16 stereo channels. These you can mixin realtime<BR><BR>and play (like a 16 track tape). For this feature, you do not need a DSP.A fast TOS <BR><BR>Computer (Medusa or Hades) is fast enough to do this without the host processor.<BR><BR>The Atari TT can play 8 Tracks at 48kHz, but only with the DSP expansionboard.<BR><BR>First of all, the quantity of tracks are dependant on the Computer speedand<BR><BR>also the speed of the hard disk. In this window, you can arrange a songfrom the<BR><BR>samples on the hard disk. For this, you load the samples and define <BR><BR>the start and end from the sample and the time position in the song (nondestructive,<BR><BR>samples are not modified). You can search the start and endpoints with the<BR><BR>tape functions (Play, Stop, Pause, Forward, Backward, Record). You can justify<BR><BR>these points with the dart buttons or a direct value entry or you can accept<BR><BR>the start and end markers from the saved sample INF file.<BR><BR>You can move the sample to another time position or track with drag anddrop or<BR><BR>direct value entry. You can use the zoom and scroll functions. With thisyou can move very<BR><BR>exactly using drag and drop. You can copy samples or complete tracks intothe clipboard.<BR><BR>Having done this, you can copy these to another position or track. You havea special<BR><BR>fileselector that lists all used samples in it's order. With this you cansearch to<BR><BR>a used sample. The program scrolls the sample into the upper left cornerof the tracker<BR><BR>window. In the fileselector you can edit the sample comments. The commentor the<BR><BR>sample filename (switchable) displays in the tracker window in the upperleft corner from<BR><BR>the sample block. The program displays the samples on it's track as a blockwith the defined<BR><BR>length. The tracker shows you also the amplitude curves from the sample.You can deselect<BR><BR>this feature for slower computers (it is calculation intensive, makes thescreen redraw<BR><BR>slower). You can select a sample with the left mouse button, you move itby click and hold right<BR><BR>mouse button (with MagicMac apple-key + mouse button). If you hold the leftshift key, on<BR><BR>the selected sample, and then let go of the mouse button, set at the backfrom the frontal sample.<BR><BR>Additionally, if you hold instead the right shift key on the selected sampleand then let go of<BR><BR>the mouse button, sets it at the front of the followed sample. This is usefulfor joining together a <BR><BR>few samples without space between the samples (e.g. for repeat samples).If you hold instead<BR><BR>the alt key, you can copy samples directly via drag and drop. If you hold<BR><BR>the alt key and ctrl key, you can copy the sample into the clipboard (dragit into the<BR><BR>clipboard in the button bar). Now, you can insert this copy into the tracker,if you click on the<BR><BR>clipboard and drag the shown sample to the playlist. You can select thestart and endpoints<BR><BR>directly with markers. For this, you push the ctrl key and and click withthe left mouse button<BR><BR>on the sample. Now the tracker loads the sample into the editor window andyou can define the<BR><BR>start and endpoint with the markers (s and e). After doing this, you clickon the quit button<BR><BR>in the editor window. This does not terminate the program, rather you leavethe editor and<BR><BR>switch to the tracker. The tracker uses the defined markers from the editorand sets the actual<BR><BR>sample block with this start and endpoints. You can copy complete tracks,if you select the<BR><BR>track number button and drag it to the clipboard. After this, you searcha free track and click<BR><BR>on the clipboard. Now you drag the displayed track number symbol to thetrack number button <BR><BR>from the free track and drop it - that&acute;s all.<BR><BR>You can save (and load) the complete playlist for future use.<BR><BR>All work with the samples in the tracker window (such as in the midi playlistwindow)<BR><BR>is non-destructive, the samples are not modified. <BR><BR>A SMPTE synchronization via MTC is indeed intended but not yet implemented.<BR><BR><BR></H4><H3><I><STRONG>- setup window (modal)</STRONG></I></H3><H4>* vertical lines: show the samples as peaks (lines) if zoom scale isgreater than 1:1<BR><BR>* link dots: unite the samples with an approximation curve if zoom scaleis greater than 1:1<BR><BR>* fill spaces: fills the space between the sample values if zoom scale isgreater than 1:1<BR><BR>* horizontal lines: horizontal marks at 20/40/60/80 percent of the amplitude<BR><BR>for better readability.<BR><BR>* Y-autozoom: zooms the amplitude automatically to the highest existingsample value <BR><BR>* grid: colored marking from the loaded samples with a grey background pattern<BR><BR>* autorecord treshold: the level in dB to begin the automatic recording<BR><BR>if you use the auto record feature<BR><BR>* malloc: reserved memory for the samples in number of bytes (Hex) <BR><BR>* record time: adjustable default record time. You can change the<BR><BR>time always before you start the recording. This is a huge labour savingfeature,<BR><BR>you must not always input the same time before you start the recording.<BR><BR>You can always stop a recording with the STOP button. <BR><BR>* HDD sektorlen: size of the load blocks from the hard disk. Use the value16384<BR><BR>for the meantime<BR><BR>* digital in clock: if set, synchronizes the sampler, the analog input andall outputs<BR><BR>to the sampling rate of the digital input (namely, use the sample rate<BR><BR>from the digital input for all). The sample rate pullup is then barred <BR><BR>because the sampler used the digital input clock.<BR><BR>* sampledata defaultpath: The name says it all: path for the sample recordand<BR><BR>sample play (HDR) from the hard disk. All other files search and save the<BR><BR>program in the start path of the program.<BR><BR>* default format: type of the file extender for sample files, the defaultsample format.<BR><BR>You can use another format. It&acute;s merely a labour saving feature atwork.<BR><BR>* 3D: colored look of the program interface in the MultiTOS look (as closeas possible)<BR><BR>The program considers it first after a new start of the program !!!<BR><BR>* flip: if set, flips the function popup in the edit window being used backto the<BR><BR>MARK function (because this is the most used function)<BR><BR>if reset, remains selected to the last used function.<BR><BR>* 0-XSNAP: search to zero values in the sample data (for loop points) with<BR><BR>shift to render possible.<BR><BR>* Menu: dropdown menu at the top of the screen <BR><BR>The program considers it first after a new start of the program !!!<BR><BR>* Time: displays the time in the edit info zone and allows an auto backup<BR><BR>* Show: show the time position from the mouse respectively marker in theedit info zone<BR><BR>* Turbo: for time optimized record/play with normal Mega STE&acute;s becauseof the small<BR><BR>computer power. A relic from older times. You should leave it set.<BR><BR>* Freeze: if set, notice the window positions in the setup of the program(with save in the setup).<BR><BR>and set these windows on these positions at the next start of the program<BR><BR>* View: Here you can select between display time position (in 1/100 sec)or display sample values<BR><BR>* Save: save the setup file &quot;SMP16.INF&quot;<BR><BR>* Load: load the setup file. The program loads this file automatically thenext time it is started too.</H4><PRE> </PRE><H4>This is not a complete explanation of the program, there is not enoughspace here for that.<BR><BR>For a test this should be sufficient in the meantime. <BR><BR>I have created a hypertext file with screenshots of the explained programsections<BR><BR>but only in the german language. I will this translate to english in thenext few weeks.<BR><BR>The hypertext is the best way, to explain the program sections (in my opinion).<BR><BR>The demo version has this hypertext included. You click on the HELP Button(or press<BR><BR>the HELP Key) to call it up in the program. The hypertext is written forthe 1stGuide accessory.<BR><BR>The size of the windows are limited to 640x400 for use without graphicscards in ST screen size.<BR><BR>If you have a screen size greater then or equal to 1024x768, the programuses another resource file<BR><BR>with larger windows for the editor window and the tracker window.<BR><BR>In the future I will implement windows with variable size. But you can alsofill the screen with all<BR><BR>the nonmodal windows without this feature. ;-)<BR><BR>The program should run with all graphics cards (in colour).<BR><BR>Another tip: you should make the work, and click cool on all objects.<BR><BR>A few functions in the editor are well hidden, you should search if youdon&acute;t know what to do.<BR><BR>The program is really not bugfree. This alpha version is still in development.<BR><BR>Stay cool and don&acute;t worry - be happy !<BR><BR>The program is fully functional except the record/play function (you haven&acute;t<BR><BR>a soundcard hardware for this anyway!). This demo version is freeware !<BR><BR>If you have any questions or wishes or suggestions, send me an email ora letter.<BR><BR><BR>My adress: Stephan Wilhelm, Niehler Str.312, 50735 K&ouml;ln, Germany<BR><BR><BR>Internet email-adress &quot;stepwil@aol.com&quot;</H4><HR ALIGN="LEFT"><STRONG><A HREF="emain.html">back to mainpage...</A></STRONG></BODY></HTML>
