Only the mixingfrom the <BR>tracks is executed in Assembler. By optimizing the load routines in Assembleris it<BR>most likely, that you can have more tracks mixing.<BR>The complete calculations are done by the host mainprocessor (68060) inthe Hades<BR>and not from the DSP. The DSP can operate in parallel to the hostprocessorfor<BR>calculating DSP Effects.<BR><BR></H3><H2>The HDR soundcard is now tested on the Atari TT:<BR></H2><H3>The TT is not the fastest machine for such hungry applications.<BR>For that, you should absolutely use the DSP expansion for the StartrackCard. <BR>With the DSP expansion a normal untuned TT can work and play 8 Tracks<BR>at 48kHz sample rate without speed problems !<BR><BR>Altogether (in my opinion) the Hades is ideal for Hard disk recording.<BR>It has a great System Performance with the fast TOS System<BR>(more then PCs and Apples ?).</H3><HR ALIGN="LEFT"><STRONG><A HREF="emain.html">back to mainpage...</A></STRONG></BODY></HTML>
