StarTrack Utility START_MC.PRG
------------------------------

For use the StarTrack Audiocard with Musicom, the Audiocard must be
initialize a few special things for correct work with it.
For an easier handling, we maked a little Utility-Program
that initialize the Audiocard and starts Musicom.

Requirements: a DSP-Expansion and TOS ( it runs not with MagiC)
and a loaded Audiodriver SOUND.PRG.
Copy the SOUND.PRG in the AUTO-Folder, that's the best way.

Copy the Startup-Program "START_MC.PRG" in the filepath of the program.

That's all, start now START_MC.PRG.
