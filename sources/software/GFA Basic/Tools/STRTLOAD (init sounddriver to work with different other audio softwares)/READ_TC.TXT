StarTrack Utility START_TC.PRG
------------------------------

For use the StarTrack Audiocard with Trakcom, the Audiocard must be
initialize a few special things for correct work with it.
For an easier handling, we maked a little Utility-Program
that initialize the Audiocard and starts Trackcom.

Requirements: a DSP-Expansion and MagiC (Trackcom requires TOS 4.0
compatibility) and a loaded Audiodriver SOUND.PRG.
Copy the SOUND.PRG in the AUTO-Folder, that's the best way.

Copy the Startup-Program "START_TC.PRG" in the filepath of the program.

That's all, start now START_TC.PRG.

When you have loaded a Tracker-File (Extension .SNG) in Trackcom,
you should switch to the correct samplerate, the Audiocard support
not all Samplerates of Trackcom.
Go to the Menu-Dropdown "Optionen" and go to the Menupoint
"Einstellungen". Here you should select the samplerate
(Abspielfrequenz) 48 kHz.

When you have leave the Dialogbox, you can start the Playback with
a push on the Return-Key.
