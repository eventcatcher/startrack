StarTrack Utility START_WR.PRG
------------------------------

For use the StarTrack Audiocard with Winrec, the Audiocard must be
initialize a few special things for correct work with it.
For an easier handling, we maked a little Utility-Program
that initialize the Audiocard and starts Winrec.

Requirements: a DSP-Expansion and MagiC (Winrec requires TOS 4.0
compatibility) and a loaded Audiodriver SOUND.PRG.
Copy the SOUND.PRG in the AUTO-Folder, that's the best way.

Copy the Startup-Program "START_WR.PRG" in the filepath of the program.

That's all, start now START_WR.PRG.
