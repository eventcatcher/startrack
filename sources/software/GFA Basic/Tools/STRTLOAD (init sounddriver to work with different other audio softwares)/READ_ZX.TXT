StarTrack Utility START_ZX.PRG
------------------------------

For use the StarTrack Audiocard with Zero_X, the Audiocard must be
initialize a few special things for correct work with it.
For an easier handling, we maked a little Utility-Program
that initialize the Audiocard and starts Zero_X.

Requirements: a DSP-Expansion and a loaded Audiodriver SOUND.PRG.
Copy the SOUND.PRG in the AUTO-Folder, that's the best way.

Copy the Startup-Program "START_ZX.PRG" in the filepath of the program.

That's all, start now START_ZX.PRG.

Zero_x writes direct in the Hardware-Registers to select the
samplerate. That's the problem why Zero_X cannot switch the
Samplerate of the StarTrack Audiocard.
The Developers of Zero_X are informed about this problem and
works on a debugged version for StarTrack. The rest works.
